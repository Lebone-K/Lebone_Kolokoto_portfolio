                <p>My name and surname is Lebone Kolokoto. I am a nineteen year old who believes that he can achieve anything he sets himself out to do. Art is my passion. I am naturally creative and a hard worker at that. Coding has recently found it's way into my life as I needed to learn a new and exciting skill and so far have learnt more than I thought I would in a short space of time, that being HTML, CSS and front-end Javascript.</p>
